Personally, as much as I appreciate the idea of giving as detailed feedback as possible, I think giving lists of options is always going to result in either overwhelming the asker or sending incorrect referrals.

In this specific case, I'd prefer to give a general off-topic for Stack Overflow reason, and provide resources for how to correctly determine which site they _should_ ask on.


For this reason I propose something along the lines of:

| Field | Text | Markdown Length |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Brief description | Not about programming or software development | 45 |
| Usage guidance | This question does not appear to be about a specific programming problem, software algorithm, or tools commonly used by programmers. It may belong on [a different Stack Exchange site](https://stackexchange.com/sites) or other external site. | 240 |
| Post notice close description | **Closed.** This question is not [about programming or software development](/help/closed-questions). It is not currently accepting answers. | 140 |
| Post owner guidance  | This question does not appear to be about a specific programming problem, software algorithm, or tools commonly used by programmers. You can edit the question so it’s [on-topic](/help/on-topic) or see if it can be answered on [another site on the Stack Exchange Network](https://stackexchange.com/sites). | 304 |
| Privileged user guidance | This question does not appear to be about a specific programming problem, software development, or tools commonly used by programmers. You can edit the question so it’s [on-topic](/help/on-topic) for Stack Overflow. | 215 |

This would make the close dialogue appear as:
[![Close Dialogue with new closure reasons and no SF or SU close reasons][1]][1]

Post Owners would see the following message:
[![Post owner guidance][2]][2]

Privileged Users would see the following:
[![Privileged user guidance][3]][3]

Anonymous Users and <3k users would see the following:
[![Every user guidance][4]][4]
